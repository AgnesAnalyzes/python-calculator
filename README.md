💡 Polly – Your Python Calculator
Polly is an interactive console calculator that supports essential arithmetic operations.
This project was created as part of my Python training and focuses on input validation, error handling, and user interaction in the console.
✨ Features
Polly can perform the following operations:
➕ Addition (+)
➖ Subtraction (-)
✖️ Multiplication (*)
➗ Division (/)
🧮 Integer Division (//)
🔁 Modulo (%)
🚀 Exponentiation (**)
Additional functionality:
Validates whether both inputs are numeric
Prevents division by 0
Checks whether the chosen operator is valid
Allows repeating calculations in a loop
🧠 Program Logic
The program uses:
A custom function ist_float() to validate and convert inputs to float
A while True loop to allow continuous calculations
if/elif statements to handle operators
Clear error messages and guided user prompts
▶️ How to Run
Make sure Python 3 is installed.
Save the file (e.g., calculator.py).
